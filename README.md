# hello-world
Learning the basic and getting familiar with Github environment
Was introduced to Python programming early this year and found python programming is easier to learn and pick as compared to the programming language that I used to pick up ages ago(foxpro,dbase4). 
Looking forward to learn and eventually write a python code on my own.
