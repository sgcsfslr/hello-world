# hello-world
Learning the basic and getting familiar with Github environment:

Was introduced to Python programming early this year and found python programming much easier to learn as compared to dbase4 and foxpro during my younger days. Regretted not putting in more effort in programming then. 

Never too old, but looking forward to learn more by practicing and eventually writing a python program/code on my own.
